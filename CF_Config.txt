> LOADOUT BINDS <
Primary: 1

Primary: 0
Backup: 0

Special: 0
Sniper: 1800
Heavy: 0

- For SNIPER, set the detection interval NO LOWER than the firerate of your intended weapons.
- For all other categories, lower interval = more resource consumption
- Due to the nature of this program, the detection intervals can be a few ms lower than the real firerates

> DETECTION THRESHOLDS AND TOLERANCES (0-255) <
Red Threshold: 165
Green/Blue Tolerance: 65

- 150-200 is recommended for R threshold, 40-80 is recommended for G/B tolerance
